# c = hyperblock in ram OR hyperblock file when running only hyperblocks without ram mode on
# h = ledger file or hyperblock clone in hyperblock mode
# h2 = hyperblock file

# never remove the str() conversion in data evaluation or database inserts or you will debug for 14 days as signed types mismatch

# if you have a block of data and want to insert it into sqlite, you must use a single "commit" for the whole batch, it's 100x faster
# do not isolation_level=None/WAL hdd levels, it makes saving slow
# issues with db? perhaps you missed a commit() or two
